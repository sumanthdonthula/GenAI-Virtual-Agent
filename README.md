# AI-Powered Virtual Agent

Welcome to my AI-powered Virtual Agent project! This innovative virtual agent seamlessly responds to user prompts, providing information on my experience, projects, and curriculum.

## Key Features:

- **GPT-2 Integration:** Implemented the GPT-2 model from the Transformers library for advanced text processing tasks, including text splitting, tokenization, and similarity search.

- **Library Utilization:** Leveraged powerful libraries and modules such as langchain, FAISS, and OpenAI, along with the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, to enhance the overall functionality of the virtual agent.

## Demo:
